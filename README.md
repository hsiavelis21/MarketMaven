- To run application:
    - `cd MarketMaven`
    - `export FLASK_APP=webapp `
    - `flask run`
    
- To update dependencies (make sure you're not in MarketMaven directory): `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
- If you need to change port: `export FLASK_RUN_PORT=8000`

    - Ensure you're in virtual environment
    - Go to MarketMaven directory
    - `flask db migrate -m <message>`
